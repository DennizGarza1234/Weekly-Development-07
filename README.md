## Assigned Issue(s) Update

**Link(s) to Issue(s):**  
N/A – This week focused on coursework and skill development rather than GitHub issue-based contributions.

### Progress Summary
This week focused on reinforcing my understanding of JSX and stack data structures. I completed an assignment converting a user profile card from HTML to JSX, participated in discussions analyzing webpage-to-JSX conversion strategies, and completed three quizzes covering JSX syntax and stack fundamentals. Additionally, I prepared and recorded a technical interview demonstrating a simple text editor with undo functionality using a stack.

### Key Learnings
- Strengthened understanding of JSX syntax and conversion from HTML
- Learned best practices for structuring React components
- Reinforced stack data structures and their applications in undo functionality
- Improved technical communication skills through interview prep
- Developed strategies for handling dynamic content in React applications

### Additional Information
The technical interview prep helped improve problem-solving speed and the ability to explain coding decisions clearly. All activities this week were designed to reinforce practical React and JavaScript skills.
